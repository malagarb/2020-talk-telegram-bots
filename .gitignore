#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/telegram-bot-with-rails/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/telegram-bot-with-rails/log/*
/telegram-bot-with-rails/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/telegram-bot-with-rails/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/telegram-bot-with-rails/config/master.key
